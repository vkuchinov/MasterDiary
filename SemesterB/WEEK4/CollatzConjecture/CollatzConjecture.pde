/*

Collatz Conjecture*
[hailstone numbers]

is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. 
The conjecture is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture (after Stanis≈Çaw Ulam), 
Kakutani's problem (after Shizuo Kakutani), the Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), 
Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem;[1][2] the sequence of numbers involved 
is referred to as the hailstone sequence or hailstone numbers (because the values are usually subject to 
multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud),[3][4] or as wondrous numbers.

Basis for Hailstone Sequence and different pseudo-random numbers algorithms.
