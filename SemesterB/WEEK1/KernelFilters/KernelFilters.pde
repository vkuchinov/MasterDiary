KERNEL (image processing)
[a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix]

In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is 
a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, 
edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing 
a convolution between a kernel and an image.

g(x, y) = (w * f)(x, y) = ⅀(a, -a)⅀(b, -b)w(s, t)f(x - s, y - t)

where -a ≤ s ≥ a, -b ≤ w ≥ b

FOR EXAMPLE 3x3 BLUR

CONVOLUTION

Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to 
its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. This is related to 
a form of mathematical convolution. 

It should be noted that the matrix operation being performed - 
convolution - is not traditional matrix multiplication, despite 
being similarly denoted by *.
